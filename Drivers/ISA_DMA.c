/*
 * Inspired by https://wiki.osdev.org/ISA_DMA
 * This is just a make shift implementation and should be remade when I don't have exams
 * But, because this is so obsolete I didn't think it was worth too much time and just
 * hopped we only ever use it for floppy's.
 * At this time, it doesn't tackle memory, and just uses an address provided by some1 else
